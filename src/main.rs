//! # Rust Developer Challenge
//! 
//! ## Introduction
//! RDC is a simple Rust application that provides HTTP endpoints and responds to requests for files. Everything was done in accordance with the assignment received from Finheaven at the recruitment stage.
//! 
//! ## Assigment
//! Code up a simple http microservice that loads a JSON data structure like the one found below and responds with a .zip file whose contents are each of the source `url` named as `filename` within the final .zip archive.
//!
//! Your service should expose a URL and respond with data as soon as possible rather than make the user wait for the entire ZIP to be created first.
//! 
//! Please include instructions on how someone else can run/test your service in their own webserver or development environment.
//! 
//! ## Run and test
//! 
//! <TODO>
//! 
//! ## Implementation and decisions
//! 
//! <TODO>
