//! # Rust Developer Challenge
//!
//! ## Introduction
//! RDC is a simple Rust application that provides HTTP endpoints and responds to requests for files. Everything was done in accordance with the assignment received from Finheaven at the recruitment stage.
//!
//! ## Assigment
//! Code up a simple http microservice that loads a JSON data structure like the one found below and responds with a .zip file whose contents are each of the source `url` named as `filename` within the final .zip archive.
//!
//! Your service should expose a URL and respond with data as soon as possible rather than make the user wait for the entire ZIP to be created first.
//!
//! Please include instructions on how someone else can run/test your service in their own webserver or development environment.
//!
//! ## Run
//!
//! Easiest way to test solution is run `cargo run` and open http://localhost:8080/sample.zip in browser.
//!
//! To process custom json send it with `curl`:
//! ```bash
//! curl --request POST --data-binary "@assets/sample_files.json" http://localhost:8080/zip > ~/Downloads/sample_files.zip
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation and decisions
//!
//! ### HTTP-server
//! I choice [hyper](hyper) as base library to listening TCP port for a [`Request`'s](hyper::Request). Hyper is low-level library and allows to manipulate with [`Response`](hyper::Response) object to pipe streams to it
//!
//! ### Archiving
//! I choice [zip](zip) as library for archiving files
//!
//! ### Logging
//! Every internal processes are intrumented with [`log`](log) calls with widely used channels: [`debug`](log::debug), [`info`](log::info), [`warn`](log::warn) and [`error`](log::error).
//!
//! ### Future improvements
//! - Looks like it is possible to write non-finished incoming buffer to ZipWritter. It will improve UX
//! - Use something such as `clap` to make service configurable
//! - Checking of file name duplicates and make them unique
//! - Per file caching
